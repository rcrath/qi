Qi is a motion-to-muxic device for [max](http://cycling74.com).  Here is a better explanation and a [video of it in action](http://dahi.manoa.hawaii.edu/2013/11/digital-ah-collaboration/) on the outside wall of Kennedy theater at the University of Hawai'i at the fiftieth anniversary celebration of the UH Dance department.  The current build works on max 6 32 bit for windows.  untested on mac, and needs the older [cv.jit](http://jmpelletier.com/cvjit/) (1.72 32 bit) library installed to work.  I have never been able to get it to run on the runtime version of max, so unable to make a standalone.  now that there is a 64 bit cv.jit out, I will probably update the patch to max 7 soon.the synths are vst plugins, so you will need a vst synth, either two copies of one, or two different synths.  THere are a ton of free vst synths.  see http://kvraudio.com to find them.  One of the best is green oak's [crystal](http://www.greenoak.com/crystal/Crystal/Crystal.html). You have to install it wherever max looks for its vsts.
